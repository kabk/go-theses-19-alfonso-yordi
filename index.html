		<p> Four years ago I found myself in the search and the strive to become a graphic designer. Now little did I know what this will really mean. Learn new tools such as adobe programs? Understand typography and learn how to use it?... Graphic design became an object of desire I needed to embody it to become it.</p> 

		<p>What tools do I needed to learn and master in order to achieve this? What understanding of aesthetics was relevant, what was trendy what was a ‘thing’ what wasn’t? I found myself navigating through all this questions through all these different people that approached design in their own manner they all understood or seem to understand were to stand, what was expected of them, and what more or less were their capabilities? What were my capabilities? I believed I had none yet or the minimum in relation to the world of graphic design, I still had to learn so much. I was not questioning my capabilities I was questioning the requirements to become something I was not familiar with. What was expected of me? If I decided to embody that label ‘graphic designer’ was I supposed to understand typography, was I supposed to know all the main references of graphic design? What were the skills I was supposed to master?</p>  

		<p>‘The Graphic Design department educates students to become critical thinkers and versatile practitioners who develop outstanding concepts for visual communication. Graduates excel in their professional careers through their extraordinary conceptual and visual abilities, extensive knowledge of the profession and the world, strong technological curiosity and highly developed social engagement.’</p> 

		<p>“critical thinkers” “outstanding concepts for visual communication” “extensive knowledge of the proffesion” “strong technological curiosity” And “highly developed social engagement”…. What the fuck are these terms? Is this what I should become or aim to be?</p> 

		<p>This process of becoming seemed so important at the time and now looking back at it I try to understand why. Becoming something that I was not yet, the impossible quest that was in need of change. Somehow there was something that pushed me to achieve something greater than me. This was the problem, my quest was doomed to fail. Somehow what I valued is what I would become, the pressure was lying on me changing and becoming who I was supposed to be, but who dictates this? Who decides whats the ideal version of a designer at KABK. Because there is a curriculum and certain requirements to become a designer at KABK, There is an authority that dictates the form in which people should adapt in order to graduate. This authority dictates what a successful student looks like, and reinforces this idea that to be a successful designer you have to deliver what is expected from you as a student and nothing more. This is a very narrow way of experiencing education since discussion only can go in to directions where the authorities interest resides.</p> 

		<p>There relied graphic design , at the end of the journey, I never considered myself capable of dealing with graphic design until I reached the end of the journey, but I never seemed to move forward no matter how hard I worked.</p>

            </a>

		<p>I guess what I spent most of the time trying to understand is: what is valued in graphic design? Who defines what is valuable? What are the processes that actually create value in graphic design? 
		This questions dictated what kind of work I would be making. Somehow this idea of not being yet, was pushing me to look for the elements that would make me become. In a way it was thriving me to become, it was making me hungry for change, for the new, for learning what I was not familiar with. I considered this as very essential for my growth and understanding of my practice yet at the same time it was undermining who I was at the time and the things I knew, making my goal something distant from me where my value as a graphic designer was, the value I didn’t have yet and therefore the value I was not able to communicate through my work. In one hand I was constantly looking for things around me that reminded me of what I was not capable yet of doing, I could not stand this feeling, I had to figure it out in order to acquire this value, this skill. In the other hand this feeling was making me weak, I did not see value in myself or the work I produced, and this is something that would later ended up breaking me.</p>
